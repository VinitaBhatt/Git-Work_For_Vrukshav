    Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a Jamoon(berry) tree, which was on the bank of a river. 
In the same forest, there lived a Crocrodile & his Wife in a river.
    One day the crocodile came to the bank of the river and rested under the tree. The kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The Crocrodile came back on the next day for more fruits, as he loved them. As days passed by. the crocodile and the Monkey became 
best friends.
